# Ticket Fix Me

Ticket Fix Me is a maintenance request and tracking system focused on tenants (renters) and brings together the tenant, property owner and independent contractor/handyman. The platform will make reporting issues easier for the tenant.  For the property owner, it can help to increase tenant loyalty, help develop a network of handyman to quickly resolve problems (this is particularly attractive to the small business property owner that does not have a maintenance staff).  Lastly for the contractor, their network is expanded with the potential of increased revenue.

### Installation
  - Requires MySql installation.  
  - NodesJs Configuration parameters are stored in "config.js" located in the routes folder.  Sample contents.

    var Config = {};
    Config.mysql = {};
    Config.mysql.pool = {};
    Config.mysql.pool.connectionLimit = 100;
    Config.mysql.pool.debug = false;
    Config.mysql.host = <your MySql host name>
    Config.mysql.database = <database name>;
    Config.mysql.username = <your username>;
    Config.mysql.password = <your password>;
    Config.secret = <secret string for Json Web Tokens>
    //configuration for you mail server .. below is example only
    Config.smtpConfig =  {
      host: 'smtp.comcast.net',
      port: 587,  
      secure: false, // use SSL
      auth: {
          user: 'xxxxxxxx',
          pass: 'ppppppppppp'
      }
  };

  module.exports = Config;
 
- There are also client side parameters needed.  Create a file called "front-config.js" in the "/assets/js" directory.  Here is a sample configuration;

    //Point ajax calls to the proper nodejs instance
    var Config = {
       //ticketFixMeApi: 'http://ticketfixme.com:4000'
      ticketFixMeApi: 'http://localhost:4000'
      }

- cd to the "back-end" directory
    * run npm install
    * Note: uses port 4000
